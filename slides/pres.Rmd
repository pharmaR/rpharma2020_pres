# Definitions

<blockquote>
"The term <b>qualification</b> is used in this notice to describe <b>verification</b> of system functionality. The term <b>validation</b> is used to describe the process of establishing and documenting that the specified requirements of a computerised system can be consistently fulfilled from design until decommissioning of the system or transition to a new system (ICH E6(R2), section 1.65), i.e. it operates to defined specifications and defined procedures (SOPs) by a trained user."
.right[-- <cite>[Notice to sponsors on validation and qualification of computerised systems used in clinical trials, EMA, 07-Apr-2020](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/notice-sponsors-validation-qualification-computerised-systems-used-clinical-trials_en.pdf)</cite>]
</blockquote>

- We might **verify**
    - the results of an analysis by double programming
    - that if I call a function/macro with specific parameters then I get the expected result 
- We might **qualify**
    - a software installation, **e.g. SAS/R/python **
    - a 'multiple use' utility, e.g. a SAS macro / R function
- We might **validate**
    - a controlled workflow environment, e.g. a Statistical Computing Environment (SCE) 
    - a GxP application, eg a Shiny app

# Regulatory perspectives

## FDA

<blockquote>
"We recommend that you base your approach on a justified and <b>documented risk assessment</b> and a determination of the potential of the system to affect product quality and safety, and record integrity"
.right[-- <cite>[Guidance for Industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures — Scope and Application](https://www.fda.gov/media/75414/download)</cite>]
</blockquote>

## EMA

<blockquote>
"The sponsor may rely on qualification documentation provided by the vendor, if the qualification activities performed by the vendor have been assessed as adequate. However, the sponsor may also have to perform additional qualification (and validation) activities based on a <b>documented risk assessment.</b>"
.right[-- <cite>[Notice to sponsors on validation and qualification of computerised systems used in clinical trials, EMA, 07-Apr-2020](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/notice-sponsors-validation-qualification-computerised-systems-used-clinical-trials_en.pdf)</cite>]
</blockquote>

- Note: The above documents describe computerized systems and neither addresses address programming languages directly

<!-- # What is a Risk-based Approach? -->

<!-- - All validation is risk-based! -->


<!-- - A prioritisation of our testing strategy based on what we already know -->
<!--     - How well is the package developed / tested? -->
<!--     - How much additional exposure has it had within the user community? -->


<!-- - We generally approach commercial software this way already! -->

# Validation, R and R Packages

The FDA provide a clear definition of validation in the [Glossary of Computer System Software Development Terminology](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspection-guides/glossary-computer-system-software-development-terminology-895). 

This can be broken down into three core components:

1.	Accuracy
2.	Reproducibility
3.	Traceability 

The focus of the white paper is accuracy.

# What do we mean by 'R'?

- **Core R (Base+Recommended)** - Low risk
    - See [R: Regulatory Compliance and Validation Issues...](https://www.r-project.org/doc/R-FDA.pdf). 
    
    
- **Contributed** - Variable risk  
    - Many different authors
    - Varying SDLCs
    - Varying levels of popularity
    - Potentially lots of unknowns

<!-- <img src="images/German-et-al.png" alt="source: German-et-al" height="120px" > -->


We propose a risk-based approach to establish accuracy/validity for contributed packages

# Classifying R Packages within an Installation

- Within an installation, two classifications of R packages are proposed:

1. **Intended for Use**. These will be loaded directly by a user during an R session.
2. **Imports**. These packages are required to be installed in order to use the Intended for Use packages. They are comparable to a system dependency, or the ‘back-end’ code supporting a user interface.

- A risk-based approach to validation should focus on the way that components of the system are **intended to be used**.

#	An R Package Risk Assessment Framework

We propose to assess the risk of contributed R packages based on four criteria:

-	Purpose

-	Maintenance Good Practice (Software Development Life Cycle, SDLC)

-	Community Usage

-	Testing (Also part of an SDLC)


---
# Pupose

- What will the package used for?


- Is it...


1. Statistical?
2. Non-statistical?


- Hence, how difficult is it for an end user to identify errors?


> "Tests should be written for all statistical modelling functions within an Intended for Use Statistical Package, regardless of the risk assessment."


- To be challenged later...

---
# Maintenance / Testing / Community Usage

- Development and **maintenance** best practice are essential for any software
    - How are bugs managed?
    - What is the documentation like?
    - Is the source code on GitHub?
- **Testing** is a crucial part of an SDLC and another specific maintenance best practice metric

- Increased exposure to users (**community usage**) helps to reduce risk

- More on these coming up...
